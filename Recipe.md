Recipe: 

Step-1: In a bowl, take Milk, Oil, Vanilla Essence and Sugar. Mix well until sugar dissolves.

Step-2: Take another bowl. Mix All-purpose flour, Baking soda, Baking powder, Coffee powder and Cocoa powder in it. Sieve all the dry ingredients all together. Don’t skip this step to save time. Sifting not only removes the unwanted particles but also helps to aerate the dry ingredients. This result in spongy cakes and muffins.

Step-3: Mix all the dry ingredients into wet ingredients and fold gently to make a smooth batter. The batter should be lumps free and of pouring consistency. In case you feel to add more milk do that as every flour has different absorption capacity. 

Step-4: Add one tablespoon of Vinegar to the batter and keep the batter aside for 5 minutes.

Step-5: While doing all the above steps, preheat the oven to 180 °C for 10 minutes.

Step-6: Take a muffin tray and arrange muffin liners in it.

Step-7: Fill all the muffin molds up to ¾. Sprinkle some Choco chips.

Step-8: Bake these muffins at 180 °C for 25 minutes or until they pass the toothpick test. Once done, take out baked muffins and let them cool.
